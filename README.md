- 👋 Hi, I’m @AJSpaceWitch also known as Amelia
- 👀 I’m interested in many things! I have recently finished a Masters by Research in Astrophysics studying Wolf Rayet stars.
- 🌱 I use Python and IRAF most often in my work. I’m currently self-studying HTML and CSS. I have also used IDL and Fortran77 during my studies.
- 💞️ My current goal is to create Python equivalents to some of the IRAF and IDL tools I've used for research.
- 📫 You can reach me on the same tag on twitter.

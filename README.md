- 👋 Hi, I’m @AJSpaceWitch also known as Amelia
- 👀 I’m interested in many things! I'm currently doing a Masters by Research in Astrophysics studying Wolf Rayet stars.
- 🌱 I use Python and IRAF most often in my work. I’m currently learning HTML and CSS. I'm not actively studying IDL or Fortran but I do intend to pick them back up eventually.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything, but I'd be open to working on tools for Astronomers using Python.
- 📫 You can reach me on the same tag on twitter.
